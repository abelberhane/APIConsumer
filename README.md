# API Consumer

C# Windows Form Application that Creates an HTTP Request and Gets a Response. Developing and Workingw ith consuming APIs has been interesting
and new over the last month or two. I am trying a new method of creating HTTP requests and handling them. 

I am having difficulty at the moment and am Not really getting any indiciations as to what is occuring. I am not able to get a request. 
My next idea is to use a function that populates messages to the output window in Visual studio and research some debugging methods.
